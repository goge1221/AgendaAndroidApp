# Project Overview

This application was conceived and developed with a focus on accessibility, specifically designed to assist individuals with visual difficulties. The journey from concept to launch involved planning, implementation, and adaptation to ensure the app meets its user accessibility goals. Developed in Kotlin, this project served as an excellent opportunity to refine my skills in the language while creating a meaningful tool for the community.

## 1. Planning and Design Phase

The initial phase centered around laying a solid foundation for the app's development:

- **Functionality Definition:** A thorough analysis was conducted to identify essential features, ensuring the app delivers its intended value while maintaining simplicity and usability.
- **Modular Design:** Functions were organized into modules, promoting a clean **separation of concerns** and enhancing maintainability.
- **Architecture Planning:** Determined the optimal number of fragments required, assigning specific functionalities to each to facilitate a seamless user experience.
- **Technology Selection:** Kotlin, motivated by the dual goals of leveraging its modern features and furthering my expertise in the language.

## 2. Implementation Phase

The development process was characterized by iterative enhancements, from basic layouts to complex functionalities:

- **Initial Layout:** Began with simple visual representations to display the data received from the contacts database.
- **Data Retrieval:** Implemented **Android ViewModels** for efficient contact data management across fragments, enhancing performance and user experience by minimizing data fetching operations.
- **CRUD Operations:** Developed dedicated fragments for adding new contacts and detailed views for displaying existing contacts, offering management capabilities (create, read, update, delete).
- **Design Patterns:** Applied the **Observer Pattern** and programmed against **interfaces** to ensure robust, maintainable updates to the contacts list, aligning with the **SOLID** principles.
- **UI Overhaul and Permissions:** Refined the user interface and implemented a reusable Permission Handler to streamline the process of obtaining necessary permissions, adhering to the **DRY** principle.

#### Encountered Challenges
Adapting the app for users with seeing difficulties posed unique challenges:

- **Font Size Adaptation:** Addressed issues arising from the use of large fonts, particularly when combined with the device's maximum font setting, through dynamic resizing of UI elements.

## 3. Rollout

The app's release involved a comprehensive preparation process:

- **Preparation for Launch:** Established an Android developer account and familiarized myself with Google Play's release process.
- **Marketing Materials:** Designed an appealing app logo, created engaging screenshots for the app's landing page, and developed a privacy policy website.
